# There is an airflow related blob-storage container required as a part of the deployment when deploying airflow

# This is done because airflow doesn't allow any way of configuring the container name in the azure blob store and assumes `airflow-logs` as the container name where airflow writes its logs (Airflow 2.3.3 with it's associated helm chart).

# Hence `airflow_container` is not declared from top level and we set it in the locals here.
