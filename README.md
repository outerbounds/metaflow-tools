# ⚒️ Metaflow Admin Tools

This repository contains various configuration files, tools and utilities for operating [Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow) in production. See [Metaflow documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org) for more information about Metaflow architecture. Top level folders are structured as follows:

## Metaflow on AWS (/aws)
### Metaflow Cloudformation template
If you're not already using Terraform, this is the easiest way to get started on AWS. You can find the template under [aws/cloudformation](./aws/cloudformation) in this repository.
This stack uses AWS Batch for compute and AWS Step Functions for orchestration.

### Sample Terraform templates for AWS
Another deployment option is using Terraform. An end-to-end example can be found under [aws/terraform](./aws/terraform) in this repository. The example leverages the official Terraform module [outerbounds/terraform-aws-metaflow](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/outerbounds/metaflow/aws/latest) as a building block.
This stack uses AWS Batch for compute and AWS Step Functions for orchestration.

## Metaflow on Azure (/azure)
### Sample Terraform templates for Azure
This is the quickest way to spin up a fully functional Metaflow stack on Azure. See details under [azure/terraform](./azure/terraform) in this repository.
This stack uses Kubernetes (AKS) for compute and Argo Workflows for orchestration.

## Metaflow services on Kubernetes (/k8s)
### Helm Charts (alpha)
We provide Helm charts to deploy Metaflow Metadata service and UI in a K8S cluster. This way you can use Metaflow without any AWS-specific dependencies on AWS except for having a S3-compatible object storage engine available. You can find them under [k8s/helm/metaflow](./k8s/helm/metaflow) in this repository.

## Cloud agnostic resources (/common)
### Sample Metaflow flow definitions
Some Metaflow flows that could be used to test drive a Metaflow stack. Some of these flows
are used to drive end-to-end CI coverage internally at Outerbounds.  They live under [common/sample_flows](./common/sample_flows)

## Utility scripts (/scripts)
Scripts that make life easier either deploying or using your new Metaflow stacks.

## Precommit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) to do some basic linting and other checks on this repo. You can see all linting steps in [the precommit config](.pre-commit-config.yaml).
